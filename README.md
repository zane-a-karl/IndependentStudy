# IndependentStudy
For notes and answers to textbook questions written in latex

Some initial ideas for things to work on:
latex:
 - [ ] take a look at this repo for some init organization detail
  - https://github.com/dspinellis/latex-advice
  - note you'll be writting these in overleaf so maybe this repo isn't really necessary?

Math:
 - [ ] Terry Tao's analysis book or another you already have
 - [ ] One of the Linear alg books you have
 - [ ] One of the diff eq books you have
 - [ ] One of the Complex analysis books you have

CS:
 - [ ] Intro to the theory of computation by sipser
 - [ ] copy down networking a top-down-approach answers
 - [ ] the OS textbook you have
 - [ ] the computer architechture book you have

EE:
 - [ ] Notes and work and diagrams from the khan academy course
 - [ ] maybe the ieee WRAP ltspice projects
